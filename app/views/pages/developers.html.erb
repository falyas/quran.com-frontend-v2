        <h2>Development help</h2>

        <p>
          Asalamu Alykom,

          Firstly, thank you very much for your interest to help us develop Quran.com and it's projects. We are excited
          to
          work with you!
        </p>

        <p>
          We are a team of developers, designers, product managers and thinkers working on Quran.com on a volunteer
          basis.
          Alhamdulilah we have been blessed to work for some great companies in Silicon Valley, Toronto and UAE - and we
          feel
          that this is the least we can do to help our ummah move forward in learning and studying their religion.
          Working on Quran.com is very gratifying and may Allah reward us all (and reward you) for our efforts.
        </p>

        <p>

          Typically we use Github issues as the source for what to work on next, what's coming up and what bugs exist
          that
          need to be solved.
          For example <a href="https://github.com/quran/quran.com-frontend-v2/issues" target="_blank">https://github.com/quran/quran.com-frontend-v2/issues</a> contains bugs, things we need help with, and
          great
          for starters.
        </p>

        <p>
          Should you have any questions or want to contact maintainers, just write an issue! We will get back to you as
          soon
          as we can, inshallah.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thanks for reading! Looking forward to seeing you commit some code!
